This site is a prototype for a [World of Twilight](http://worldoftwilight.com) reference. Currently the purpose is to gather feedback on what players need.

For faster prototyping it's implemented as a static site with no JavaScript at all. However my plan is for the site to be dynamic and probably implemented as a single page app. I'm not sure at this stage if it needs to work offline.

Get in touch and tell me what works, what doesn't and what would make it awesome.
